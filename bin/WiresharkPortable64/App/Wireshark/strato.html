<h2 id="_description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>strato</strong> is a system call and log analyzer.
It lets you capture system call and log events from a live source, or read events from a previously saved
capture file, either printing a decoded form of those events to the
standard output or writing the packets to a file.  <strong>strato</strong>'s native
capture file format is <strong>scap</strong> format, which is also the format used
by <strong>Stratoshark</strong>, <strong>Falco</strong>, <strong>sysdig</strong> and various other tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Without any options set, <strong>strato</strong> will work much like <strong>sysdig</strong>.  It
will use the libscap and libsinsp to capture traffic from the first available
source and displays a summary line on the standard output for
each received packet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When run with the <strong>-r</strong> option, specifying a capture file from which to
read, <strong>strato</strong> will again work much like <strong>sysdig</strong>, reading packets
from the file and displaying a summary line on the standard output for
each packet read.  <strong>strato</strong> is able to detect, read and write the same
capture files that are supported by <strong>Stratoshark</strong>.  The input file
doesn&#8217;t need a specific filename extension; the file format and an
optional gzip, Zstandard, or LZ4 compression will be automatically detected.  Near the
beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of <a href="wireshark.html">wireshark</a>(1) or
<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html" class="bare">https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html</a> is a detailed
description of the way <strong>Wireshark</strong> handles this, which is the same way
<strong>strato</strong> handles this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Compressed file support uses (and therefore requires) the zlib library.
If the zlib library is not present when compiling <strong>strato</strong>, it will be
possible to compile it, but the resulting program will be unable to read
compressed files. Similarly, LZ4 and ZStandard also require their respective
libraries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When displaying events on the standard output, <strong>strato</strong> writes, by
default, a summary line containing the fields specified by the
preferences file (which are also the fields displayed in the packet list
pane in <strong>Wireshark</strong>), although if it&#8217;s writing packets as it captures
them, rather than writing packets from a saved capture file, it won&#8217;t
show the "frame number" field.  If the <strong>-V</strong> option is specified, it
instead writes a view of the details of the packet, showing all the
fields of all protocols in the packet.  If the <strong>-O</strong> option is
specified, it will only show the full details for the protocols
specified, and show only the top-level detail line for all other
protocols.  Use the output of "<strong>strato -G protocols</strong>" to find the
abbreviations of the protocols you can specify.  If the <strong>-P</strong> option is
specified with either the <strong>-V</strong> or <strong>-O</strong> options, both the summary line
for the entire packet and the details will be displayed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Packet capturing is performed with the pcap library.  That library
supports specifying a filter expression; packets that don&#8217;t match that
filter are discarded.  The <strong>-f</strong> option is used to specify a capture
filter.  The syntax of a capture filter is defined by the pcap library;
this syntax is different from the display filter syntax described below,
and the filtering mechanism is limited in its abilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Display filters in <strong>strato</strong>, which allow you to select which packets are
to be decoded or written to a file, are very powerful; more fields are
filterable in <strong>strato</strong> than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax
you can use to create your filters is richer.  As <strong>strato</strong> progresses,
expect more and more protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.
Display filters use the same syntax as display and color filters in
<strong>Wireshark</strong>; a display filter is specified with the <strong>-Y</strong> option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Display filters can be specified when capturing or when reading from a
capture file.  Note that capture filters are much more efficient
than display filters, and it may be more difficult for <strong>strato</strong> to keep up
with a busy network if a display filter is specified for a live capture, so
you might be more likely to lose packets if you&#8217;re using a display filter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A capture or display filter can either be specified with the <strong>-f</strong> or <strong>-Y</strong>
option, respectively, in which case the entire filter expression must be
specified as a single argument (which means that if it contains spaces,
it must be quoted), or can be specified with command-line arguments
after the option arguments, in which case all the arguments after the
filter arguments are treated as a filter expression.  If the filter is
specified with command-line arguments after the option arguments, it&#8217;s a
capture filter if a capture is being done (i.e., if no <strong>-r</strong> option was
specified) and a display filter if a capture file is being read (i.e., if a
<strong>-r</strong> option was specified).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the <strong>-w</strong> option is specified when capturing packets or reading from
a capture file, <strong>strato</strong> does not display packets on the standard
output.  Instead, it writes the packets to a capture file with the name
specified by the <strong>-w</strong> option.  Note that display filters are currently
not supported when capturing and saving the captured packets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to write the decoded form of packets to a file, run
<strong>strato</strong> without the <strong>-w</strong> option, and redirect its standard output to
the file (do <em>not</em> use the <strong>-w</strong> option).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want the packets to be displayed to the standard output and also
saved to a file, specify the <strong>-P</strong> option in addition to the <strong>-w</strong>
option to have the summary line displayed, specify the <strong>-V</strong> option
in addition to the <strong>-w</strong> option to have the details of the packet
displayed, and specify the <strong>-O</strong> option, with a list of protocols, to
have the full details of the specified protocols and the top-level
detail line for all other protocols to be displayed.  If the <strong>-P</strong>
option is used together with the <strong>-V</strong> or <strong>-O</strong> option, the summary line
will be displayed along with the detail lines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When writing packets to a file, <strong>strato</strong>, by default, writes the file
in <strong>pcapng</strong> format, and writes all of the packets it sees to the output
file.  The <strong>-F</strong> option can be used to specify the format in which to
write the file.  The list of available file formats is displayed by the
<strong>-F</strong> option without a value.  However, for a live capture, you can only
specify a file format supported by <a href="dumpcap.html">dumpcap</a>(1), viz.
<strong>pcapng</strong> or <strong>pcap</strong>. The <strong>--compress</strong> option can be used to specify
a compression method as well; the list of supported compression methods
for writing can be displayed by the <strong>--compress</strong> method without an
argument. If the <strong>--compress</strong> option is not given, then the desired
compression method, if any, is deduced from the extension of the filename
given as argument to the <strong>-w</strong> option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When capturing packets, <strong>strato</strong> writes to the standard error an
initial line listing the interfaces from which packets are being
captured and, if packet information isn&#8217;t being displayed to the
terminal, writes a continuous count of packets captured to the standard
output.  If the <strong>-q</strong> option is specified, neither the continuous count
nor the packet information will be displayed; instead, at the end of the
capture, a count of packets captured will be displayed.  If the <strong>-Q</strong>
option is specified, neither the initial line, nor the packet
information, nor any packet counts will be displayed.  If the <strong>-q</strong> or
<strong>-Q</strong> option is used, the <strong>-P</strong>, <strong>-V</strong>, or <strong>-O</strong> option can be used to
cause the corresponding output to be displayed even though other output
is suppressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When reading packets, the <strong>-q</strong> and <strong>-Q</strong> option will suppress the
display of the packet summary or details; this would be used if <strong>-z</strong>
options are specified in order to display statistics, so that only the
statistics, not the packet information, is displayed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>-G</strong> option is a special mode that simply causes <strong>strato</strong>
to dump one of several types of internal glossaries and then exit.</p>

to seek backwards on the input, and as such cannot be used with live captures

filesize is reached.  When reading a capture file, <strong>strato</strong> will stop reading
the file after the number of bytes read exceeds this number (the complete
packet  will be read, so more bytes than this number may be read).  Note that

<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the <em>files</em> option it&#8217;s also possible to form a "ring buffer".
This will fill up new files until the number of files specified,
at which point <strong>strato</strong> will discard the data in the first file and start
writing to that file and so on.  If the <em>files</em> option is not set,
new files filled up until one of the capture stop conditions match (or
until the disk is full).</p>

<p><strong>files</strong>:<em>value</em> begin again with the first file after <em>value</em> number of
files were written (form a ring buffer).  This value must be less than 100000.
Caution should be used when using large numbers of files: some filesystems do
not handle many files in a single directory well.  The <strong>files</strong> criterion
requires either <strong>duration</strong>, <strong>interval</strong> or <strong>filesize</strong> to be specified to
control when to go to the next file.  It should be noted that each <strong>-b</strong>
parameter takes exactly one criterion; to specify two criterion, each must be
preceded by the <strong>-b</strong> option.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>interval</strong>:<em>value</em> switch to the next file when the time is an exact
multiple of <em>value</em> seconds.  For example, use 3600 to switch to a new file
every hour on the hour.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>nametimenum</strong>:<em>value</em> Choose between two save filename templates.  If

the original and default behaviour (e.g. log_00001_20250714164426.pcap).  If
<em>value</em> is greater than 1, make start time part before running number part
(e.g. log_20210828164426_00001.pcap).  The latter makes alphabetical sorting
order equal to creation time order, and keeps related multiple file sets in
same directory close to each other.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>strato</strong> uses UTF-8 to represent strings internally. In some cases the
output might not be valid. For example, a dissector might generate
invalid UTF-8 character sequences. Programs reading <strong>strato</strong> output
should expect UTF-8 and be prepared for invalid output.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If <strong>strato</strong> detects that it is writing to a TTY on a UNIX-compatible
system, such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, and the locale
does not support UTF-8, output will be re-encoded to match the current
locale.</p>

<p>If <strong>strato</strong> detects that it is writing to the console on Windows,
dissection output will be encoded as UTF-16LE. Other output will be
UTF-8. If extended characters don&#8217;t display properly in your terminal
you might try setting your console code page to UTF-8 (<strong>chcp 65001</strong>)
and using a modern terminal application if possible.</p>

<h2 id="_environment_variables">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_CONFIG_DIR</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable overrides the location of personal
configuration files.  On UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux, macOS,
\*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, it defaults to <em>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark</em>
(or, if that directory doesn&#8217;t exist but <em>$HOME/.wireshark</em> does
exist, <em>$HOME/.wireshark</em>); this is typically
<em>$HOME/.config/wireshark</em>.  On Windows, it defaults to
<em>%APPDATA%\Wireshark</em> (or, if %APPDATA% isn&#8217;t defined,
<em>%USERPROFILE%\Application Data\Wireshark</em>).  Available since
Wireshark 3.0.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_DEBUG_WMEM_OVERRIDE</dt>
<dd>
<p>Setting this environment variable forces the wmem framework to use the
specified allocator backend for <strong>all</strong> allocations, regardless of which
backend is normally specified by the code. This is mainly useful to developers
when testing or debugging. See <em>README.wmem</em> in the source distribution for
details.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable causes the plugins and other data files to be
loaded from the build directory (where the program was compiled) rather
than from the standard locations.  It has no effect when the program in
question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on UNIX-compatible
systems, such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_DATA_DIR</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable causes the various data files to be loaded from
a directory other than the standard locations.  It has no effect when the
program in question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on
UNIX-compatible systems.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_EXTCAP_DIR</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable causes the various extcap programs and scripts
to be run from a directory other than the standard locations.  It has no
effect when the program in question is running with root (or setuid)
permissions on UNIX-compatible systems.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_PLUGIN_DIR</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable causes the various plugins to be loaded from
a directory other than the standard locations.  It has no effect when the
program in question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on
UNIX-compatible systems.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">ERF_RECORDS_TO_CHECK</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable controls the number of ERF records checked when
deciding if a file really is in the ERF format.  Setting this environment
variable a number higher than the default (20) would make false positives
less likely.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">IPFIX_RECORDS_TO_CHECK</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable controls the number of IPFIX records checked when
deciding if a file really is in the IPFIX format.  Setting this environment
variable a number higher than the default (20) would make false positives
less likely.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_DISSECTOR_BUG</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this environment variable is set, <strong>strato</strong> will call abort(3)
when a dissector bug is encountered.  abort(3) will cause the program to
exit abnormally; if you are running <strong>strato</strong> in a debugger, it
should halt in the debugger and allow inspection of the process, and, if
you are not running it in a debugger, it will, on some OSes, assuming
your environment is configured correctly, generate a core dump file.
This can be useful to developers attempting to troubleshoot a problem
with a protocol dissector.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_TOO_MANY_ITEMS</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this environment variable is set, <strong>strato</strong> will call abort(3)
if a dissector tries to add too many items to a tree (generally this
is an indication of the dissector not breaking out of a loop soon enough).
abort(3) will cause the program to exit abnormally; if you are running
<strong>strato</strong> in a debugger, it should halt in the debugger and allow
inspection of the process, and, if you are not running it in a debugger,
it will, on some OSes, assuming your environment is configured correctly,
generate a core dump file.  This can be useful to developers attempting to
troubleshoot a problem with a protocol dissector.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_LOG_LEVEL</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable controls the verbosity of diagnostic messages to
the console. From less verbose to most verbose levels can be <code>critical</code>,
<code>warning</code>, <code>message</code>, <code>info</code>, <code>debug</code> or <code>noisy</code>. Levels above the
current level are also active. Levels <code>critical</code> and <code>error</code> are always
active.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_LOG_FATAL</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sets the fatal log level. Fatal log levels cause the program to abort.
This level can be set to <code>Error</code>, <code>critical</code> or <code>warning</code>. <code>Error</code> is
always fatal and is the default.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_LOG_DOMAINS</dt>
<dd>
<p>This environment variable selects which log domains are active. The filter is
given as a case-insensitive comma separated list. If set only the included
domains will be enabled. The default domain is always considered to be enabled.
Domain filter lists can be preceded by '!' to invert the sense of the match.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_LOG_DEBUG</dt>
<dd>
<p>List of domains with <code>debug</code> log level. This sets the level of the provided
log domains and takes precedence over the active domains filter. If preceded
by '!' this disables the <code>debug</code> level instead.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WIRESHARK_LOG_NOISY</dt>
<dd>
<p>Same as above but for <code>noisy</code> log level instead.</p>
